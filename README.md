## What is Application Framework?
> An application framework is a software library that provides a fundamental structure to support the development of applications for a specific environment. An application framework acts as the skeletal support to build an application. The intention of designing application frameworks is to lessen the cross-cutting concerns faced during the development of applications. This is achieved through the use of code that can be shared across different modules of an application.

* Logging and tracing.
