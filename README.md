## What is Application Framework?
> An application framework is a software library that provides a fundamental structure to support the development of applications for a specific environment. An application framework acts as the skeletal support to build an application. The intention of designing application frameworks is to lessen the cross-cutting concerns faced during the development of applications. This is achieved through the use of code that can be shared across different modules of an application.

### Cross cutting concerns
Cross cutting concerns are general functionalities that are commmon and not related to application business logic. 
> Below are some cross cutting application concerns
> * Logging and tracing.
> * Transaction management.
> * Security.
> * Caching.
> * Error handling.
